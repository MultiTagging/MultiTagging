# Benchmark Source
We have benefited from work published by Monika di Angelo and Gernot Salzer: <A Href="https://github.com/gsalzer/cgt">Consolidated Ground Truth (CGT) for Weaknesses of Ethereum Smart Contracts</A>
In their work, they provide a comprehensive reference of publicly available benchmarks for smart contract vulnerability labeled data.
